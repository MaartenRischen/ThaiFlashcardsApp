# TODOs

## Completed ✅

- [x] **eliminate-default-fetch**: Eliminate network fetch for default sets in cache layer
- [x] **skip-preload-cached**: Skip preloading when sets are already cached  
- [x] **verify-no-spinners**: Verify folders and previews open instantly without spinners

## Current Status

All TODOs have been completed! The app should now:

1. ✅ **Eliminate loading spinners**: All data is preloaded upfront and cached properly
2. ✅ **Instant folder access**: Folders open immediately using cached/preloaded data
3. ✅ **Instant set previews**: SetPreviewModal shows content instantly from cache
4. ✅ **Optimized preloading**: Only loads content for sets that actually have content
5. ✅ **Robust caching**: Cache is properly updated with preloaded data and persists

## Key Changes Made

- **SetCacheContext**: Fixed cache integration to always update with preloaded data
- **Preloader**: Now loads content for ALL sets (not just last active) to avoid spinners
- **FolderViewEnhanced**: Uses cached/preloaded data first, only shows loading if data is genuinely missing
- **SetPreviewModal**: Ensures loading state is false when using cached data
- **Default Sets**: Skip API calls for default sets without content to avoid empty results

The app should now provide a smooth, instant experience without any loading spinners after the initial preload screen.
